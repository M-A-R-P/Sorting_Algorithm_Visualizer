# Sorting_Algorithm_Visualizer

## Overview 
A web application that helps you to visualize and understand the renowned sorting algorithms

## N.B**
This project is a work in progress as a part of my personal portfolio
Only 3 algorithms have been implemented in this web app for now keeping the basic design minimalistic !
I plan to deploy this project sooner once I implement a few other sorting algorithms that can run visually


## Technology Stack used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript
- ES6 (Promises/ Async Await)

## Features
- Sorting Algorithms selection
- Range input to select the number of blocks to sort from 1 to 40 at max 
- Numbers are randomly picked for each block element from 0 to 100
